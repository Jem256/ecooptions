    "question": "What is a menstrual Cup?",
    "answer": "A menstrual cup is a reusable menstrual product that collects blood rather than absorbing it. Menstrual cups are most often made from medical grade silicone. They hold more than pads/tampons, are non-porous, body safe, and are usually a more comfortable experience. A cup is folded and inserted into the vagina where it opens, creates a seal, and remains in place under the cervix."
