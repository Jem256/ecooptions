        Eco Options is a asocial enterprise that was birthed from the need to 
        revolutionize menstrual care in Uganda. We aim to change attitudes and 
        improve lives through providing innovative sustainable peiod options
        for all people regardless of their income. We use the power of business
        to tackle social and environmental challenges resulting from period poverty
        in Uganda.
